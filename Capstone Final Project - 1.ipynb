    "## 2. Data Preparation\n",
    "### a. Scrapping Tokoyo Districts Table from Wikipedia\n",
    "### I first make use of Districts of Tokoyo page from Wiki to scrap the table to create a data-frame. For this, I used requests and Beautifulsoup4 library to create a data-frame containing name of the districts of Tokoyo, Area, population and 1st Major District. We start as below —\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Approach\n",
    "### Foursquare API:\n",

    "\n",
    "### Custering Approach:\n",
    "### To compare the similarities of two cities, we decided to explore neighborhoods, segment them, and group them into clusters to find similar neighborhoods in a big city like Tokyo. To be able to do that, we need to cluster data which is a form of unsupervised machine learning: k-means clustering algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "## Libraries Which are Used to Develope the Project:\n",
    "### Pandas: For creating and manipulating dataframes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Folium: Python visualization library would be used to visualize the neighborhoods cluster distribution of using interactive leaflet map.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scikit Learn: For importing k-means clustering.\n",
    "\n",
    "### JSON: Library to handle JSON files.\n",
    "\n",
    "### XML: To separate data from presentation and XML stores data in plain text format.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Geocoder: To retrieve Location Data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Beautiful Soup and Requests: To scrap and library to handle http requests.\n",
